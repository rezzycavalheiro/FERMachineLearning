Project's title: Classification of Facial Expressions Using Deep Learning

Description: This project aims to build a Facial Expresion Recognition (FER) algorithm that presents a high accuracy 
and that could be adapted for psychologists and psychiatrists to use during their appointments with their pacients. The idea
is that this tool would help the medical professionals to record and evaluate the expressions presented by their pacients,
and use the data to check if they match what the pacient is saying. This is due to people being able to say something when
they are feeling another - like someone with depressive symptoms saying they don't feel sadness, but in their expression actually 
showing this emotion.
